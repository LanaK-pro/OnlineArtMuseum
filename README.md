# Hello !

Project made by myself during a Javascript class in July 2024, first time using javascript for an entire website. Outside of small scripts made for school.

Virtual art gallery made using the free and **public API made by the Art Institute of Chicago**, every API call is contained in a function therefore it was easier for me to exploit these ressources.

Every icon is an SVG taken from [SVG REPO](https://www.svgrepo.com/) a free website for open licensed SVG.

The mouse is made using the Javascript Library called Magic Mouse : [MAGIC MOUSE](https://github.com/dshongphuc/magic-mouse-js)

Also used the library [MATERIALIZED](https://materializecss.com/) Materialized for the styling.

The forms are made with [FORMSPREE](https://formspree.io/) Formspree and the styling is made with Materialize.

**For any questions you can contact me with the form on the website**
