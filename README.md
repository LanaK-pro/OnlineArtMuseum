# Hello ! Bonjour ! ðŸ˜ŒðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Project made by myself during a Javascript class in July 2024, first time using javascript for an entire website. Outside of small scripts made for school.

**_[Online Art Exposition ](https://lanak-pro.github.io/OnlineArtMuseum/index.html)_**

## You can visit the website by clicking on the navbar on top, clicking on the title brings you back to the top. Each section represents art movements that are or have been present at the Institute in Chicago

Virtual art gallery made using the free and [PUBLIC API](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api) **made by the Art Institute of Chicago**, every API call is contained in a function therefore it was easier for me to exploit these ressources.

Every icon is an SVG taken from [Svg Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) a free website for open licensed SVG.

The mouse is made using the Javascript Library called [Magic Mouse](https://github.com/dshongphuc/magic-mouse-js)

Also used the library [Materialized](https://materializecss.com/) for the styling.

The forms are made with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and the styling is made with Materialize.

**For any questions you can contact me with the form on the website**
